This is a (growing) collection of plugins for Scout [1], a Rails based monitoring solution


Available Plugins
-----------------

* urlcontent
  Based on the URL monitioring plugin by Scout, this plugin additionally checks for the prescence of a 
  string in the response. This was triggered by an error, where a customers website was down (a GEM 
  dependency was missing) and Phusion Passenger served an error page (with a nice description of the 
  error). For Scout, everything looked ok - the website was still available after all ;)


Installation
------------

Add a plugin, and use these urls:

urlcontent: http://github.com/jcfischer/scout-plugins/raw/master/urlcontent/urlcontent.rb
